# Koblitz vertical isogeny maps are not persisted

- **Status:** `open`
- **Kind:** implementation gap and proof gap
- **Affected work:** [Koblitz isogeny rho-transfer protocol](../docs/experiments/koblitz-isogeny-rho-transfer.md), [2026-10-14 conductor-gap panel](../research/conductor_gap_panel_20261014/REPORT.md), K-163 conductor-45641 endpoints, and K-283 conductor-1697 endpoints
- **Next action owner:** unassigned executor after an experiment contract admits the map-construction work
- **Last updated:** 2026-10-31

## Problem

We cannot test whether a NIST Koblitz ECDLP becomes cheaper on the known
conductor floors, or whether the source Frobenius action remains usable after
transfer, because no durable explicit source-to-endpoint map and dual with a
subgroup-action certificate are available for the K-163 conductor-45641 or
K-283 conductor-1697 candidates.

The scoped sources are sect163k1 over its standard `F_(2^163)` polynomial and
sect283k1 over its standard `F_(2^283)` polynomial, each with its standard
prime subgroup. The candidate endpoints must retain the same trace and group
order. The required threat model distinguishes a publicly discoverable path
from supplied private advice and charges discovery accordingly.

## Evidence and uncertainty

- **Observed:**
  `research/ecc2k130_conductor_isogenies_20261007/analogues/run163_45641.gp`
  and its output generated six K-163 conductor-45641 endpoint representatives,
  while `iso163_45641.txt` retains endpoints. The generator computes kernel
  material transiently but does not persist a replayable point evaluator,
  exceptional-input behavior, normalization, or dual. The K-283
  [`README`](../research/ecc2k130_conductor_isogenies_20261007/k283/README.md)
  explicitly states that its conductor-1697 census constructs neither the
  degree-1697 map nor its dual or subgroup certificate.
- **Observed implementation progress:**
  [`MAP163_45641_PROTOCOL.md`](../research/ecc2k130_conductor_isogenies_20261007/analogues/MAP163_45641_PROTOCOL.md)
  freezes a deterministic K-163 forward-map gate and its producer.  A fresh
  seed preflight reaches endpoint orbit minimum
  `24362196697750487851526857852297647817644684697`, outside the six sampled
  historical orbits.  This exposed an invalid allow-list gate: the six are
  samples from 280 descending absolute-Frobenius orbits, not an exhaustive
  set.  The repaired producer instead tests the sampled line against both
  absolute-`tau` eigenlines and fails if it is horizontal.  The fresh endpoint
  independently passes the exact point-count/twist check and the archived
  degree-11 cycle predicate (`1` at the crater, `9128` at the endpoint).
  A second bounded relative-tower probe removes `ffembed`, constructs an
  exact-order witness, proves exact absolute x-degree 3,260 for its kernel
  line, enumerates all 22,820 half-kernel abscissae, and certifies a different
  descending endpoint before stopping at the kernel-polynomial boundary.
  Neither probe emitted a map artifact or measured a transfer.
- **Passing small-degree control:** the new local
  [`map73_dual_control.gp`](../research/isogeny_volcano_rho_20261005/map73_dual_control.gp)
  deterministically constructs a degree-73 forward map and algebraic dual on
  the `m=37` proxy.  Its retained receipt checks both compositions and
  inverse-degree recovery for 1,024 distinct frozen prime-subgroup targets,
  plus a separate planted target.  Earlier signed-map and cross-basis bridge
  evidence is retained in `aburan28/crypto` commits
  [`03ac279b2`](https://github.com/aburan28/crypto/commit/03ac279b2e0945ab8b42561df50db5b4d8475cd6)
  and
  [`2ada30059`](https://github.com/aburan28/crypto/commit/2ada300594e486850842d2fa54bcc57f72cd58f1).
  Those earlier artifacts use root finding for the reverse path and do not
  themselves provide an algebraic dual.  The new local control closes this
  proxy prerequisite; it does not certify the missing degree-45,641 map or
  dual.
- **Derived or proved:** the archived source signed-Frobenius certificates for
  all five NIST K curves pass the Stage-0 consistency audit. That audit trusts
  their point-check booleans and does not emit a primality certificate. For
  any valid degree-`d` map coprime to the subgroup order, the candidate
  transported subgroup action is
  `[d^(-1)] o phi o tau o dual(phi)`. This identity does not construct the
  missing maps or price them.
- **Machine-checked conditional transfer gate:** the
  [theory note](../research/THM_K163_COPRIME_TRANSFER1.md) and
  [formal target](../formal/targets/k163-coprime-recovery-transfer-20261031.yaml)
  reuse the standard K-163 subgroup order, kernel-check that it is coprime to
  45,641, and prove the following abstract implication: if supplied additive
  homomorphisms satisfy `recovery(phi(X)) = [45641]X`, then the forward map
  preserves and reflects scalar relations on the selected subgroup. This
  discharges the subgroup-algebra consequence only. It does not construct the
  vertical map or dual, prove either geometric composition, bind the abstract
  groups to the named curves, or establish any cost or weakness result.
- **Suspected explanation:** retaining only endpoint coefficients was enough
  for the earlier conductor census, whose objective was structural. It was
  not designed as a transfer benchmark. This explains the artifact shape but
  does not show map construction is infeasible.
- **Missing capability:** a serialized or deterministically reconstructible
  `phi` and `dual(phi)`, independent composition checks, full-size subgroup
  tests, and measured evaluation/canonicalization costs.
- **What this evidence does not establish:** it does not show the endpoints
  lack useful endomorphisms, that their best quotient is negation-only, that a
  conductor gap changes ECDLP hardness, or that no weak representative exists.
  An endpoint coefficient outside `F_2` makes absolute Frobenius move to a
  conjugate curve; the conjugate orbit is not by itself a native endpoint
  rho quotient.

## What would unblock it

- [ ] Admit the K-163/K-283 construction work with a frozen experiment
  contract and canonical launcher; the current selector has no runnable row.
- [ ] Persist or deterministically rebuild one K-163 degree-45641 or K-283
  degree-1697 `phi` and its dual, including complete endpoint identities,
  kernel representation, normalization, field of definition, exceptional
  inputs, and artifact hashes.
- [ ] Verify both dual compositions, map a standard generator to a nonzero
  point of exact prime order, recover planted logarithms back on the source,
  and certify or reject the transported signed-Frobenius action on the target
  subgroup.
- [ ] Measure construction and evaluation under the matched five-arm protocol
  with all representation conversions and failures retained.

The first three conditions are prerequisites for a valid transfer experiment.
The fourth is additionally required before any performance or weakness
inference.

The conditional Lean theorem above closes none of these checklist items: it
states what follows after the missing map, homomorphism, composition, and
subgroup hypotheses have been certified.

## Next discriminating step

- **Action or proof obligation:** with the degree-73 map/dual prerequisite now
  passing, admit and execute the relative-tower K-163 conductor-45,641
  forward-map producer under a frozen contract.  Then construct its algebraic
  dual and replay both compositions and recovery on planted subgroup points
  before optimizing or comparing one-time versus transported actions.
  Separately, execute K-283's endpoint census before admitting it as a
  map-construction target; a census result alone does not satisfy this gate.
- **Inputs and controls:** the existing `m=37` crater/73-floor pair, standard
  sect163k1 identity, the frozen relative-tower endpoint with orbit minimum
  `664574991296028830578085892445595444511031875`, exhaustive
  toy point-map checks, wrong-kernel and wrong-normalization mutations,
  identity path, one-time transfer, and the source signed-Frobenius incumbent.
- **Execution limits and stop condition:** first produce one exact replayable
  map certificate. Stop performance inference on any map, dual, subgroup,
  exception, or planted-log failure; preserve the failure as implementation
  evidence.
- **Outcomes and next actions:** a passing certificate admits the five-arm
  cost experiment; a construction failure keeps the route indeterminate and
  identifies the failed representation; a valid but expensive map supplies a
  measured gate cost; discovery of a cheap target action adds an arm rather
  than being folded into negation-only.
- **Recheck trigger:** a committed explicit map/dual artifact or a new
  construction method for either named conductor direction.

## Resolution and history

Unresolved. The 2026-10-31 Lean target machine-checks the coprime recovery
implication but leaves the concrete K-163 and K-283 maps, duals, compositions,
and measurements open. This record names a missing transfer certificate; it
is not a negative result about the isogeny class or ECDLP.
