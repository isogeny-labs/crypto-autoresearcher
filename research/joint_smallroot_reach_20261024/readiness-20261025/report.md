# Weighted reach, conditional cost, and solver readiness

This is an additive accounting and software-readiness report. No new joint-system
scientific trial, root recovery, random-target measurement, or IC speedup is
reported. The original audit and independent review remain unchanged.

## Inputs and observations

- Archived finite input: `../artifacts/finite-audit.json`, published before this
  continuation; three joint union-support candidates at multiplicities 1, 2, 3.
  Their algebraic fixture has a=2, b=3, xQ=5 and six integer unknowns. No subgroup
  identity or random target distribution was specified; none is inferred.
- External implementation: [keeganryan/cuso](https://github.com/keeganryan/cuso),
  commit `fb2747d2105a8e48499bf10a3a717cf80c14d079`, package version 0.4.0,
  LGPL-3.0-or-later. Its README links Ryan's
  [eprint 2024/1577](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1577). No source is vendored.
- Software readiness observed: SageMath 10.9, CPython 3.12.15, igraph 1.0.0,
  fpylll 0.6.4. The documented `examples/symbolic/rsa_affine_padding.py` completed
  and printed delta*=1/3. Its complete stdout/stderr is retained in
  `cuso-univariate-readiness.log`. This is one documented univariate calibration,
  not a joint-system result. No time or peak-RSS measurement was captured.
- External source inspection: `src/cuso/symbolic/optimal.py` calls
  `J.groebner_basis()`; `symbolic/asymptotic.py` constructs the ideal and calls
  the optimal-shift routine. The implementation therefore has a Gröbner
  preprocessing cost. It cannot yet substantiate a claim that this route
  bypasses Gröbner costs. This differs from claiming that all shift approaches
  require a particular finite-field solving degree.
- The README's span guarantee does not guarantee efficient lattice reduction,
  enough independent relations, or root recovery. The symbolic return value
  is explicitly heuristic, within its specified construction and assumptions.

## Derived weighted accounting

Write leaf bounds as X=p^beta and internal-node bounds as Y=p^gamma. There
are four leaves and two non-root internal nodes. For the archived triangular
families, let sL and sI be the respective coordinate exponent sums, N the row
count, and K=tN-q. Their determinant-level sufficient region is

`4*sL*beta + 2*sI*gamma < K`.

This region omits the LLL and evaluation-norm losses. A sufficient first-vector
bound includes the factor `sqrt(N)*2^((N-1)/4)` multiplying det(L)^(1/N).
For finite p the corresponding right-hand-side budget is reduced by
`N*log_p(sqrt(N)*2^((N-1)/4))`. Even satisfying this stronger condition
does not supply enough independent integer polynomials for extraction.

| t | N | weighted inequality before losses | dense entries | upper ceiling on 3beta+2gamma in this region |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | 31 | 44beta+38gamma < 3 | 961 | 9/44 |
| 2 | 382 | 1140beta+938gamma < 98 | 145924 | 49/190 |
| 3 | 2591 | 12048beta+9620gamma < 1280 | 6713281 | 80/251 |

The last column is exact rational algebra on archived statistics, not a new
shift search. For beta,gamma >= 0, set A=4sL, B=2sI. Then
`3beta+2gamma <= max(3/A,2/B)*(A*beta+B*gamma)`; for these three rows the maximum
is 3/A. Thus the displayed ceilings are 3K/A. The graph plots these sufficient
regions. A point outside a region lacks this certificate; it is not proved
unrecoverable. Dense entries measure structural storage growth, not bytes,
peak memory, reduction time, or an algorithmic lower bound.

## Conditional cost model and measurable goal

The following is a model, with unvalidated assumptions: window restrictions
behave as independent uniform field-coordinate restrictions; the four-leaf
system produces expected usable decompositions proportional to
`lambda=p^(4beta+2gamma-3)`; the extractor succeeds with bounded nonzero
probability conditional on a solution; duplicates, sign ambiguities and rank
do not introduce exponent losses; the subgroup has order Theta(p); and sparse
linear algebra costs p^(2beta+o(1)). For lambda <= 1, collecting p^beta usable
relations using attempts costing p^(tau+o(1)) gives the optimistic exponent

`C(beta,gamma,tau)=max(3-3beta-2gamma+tau, 2beta)`.

Here tau is an attack-cost exponent. It is NOT the symbolic shift-tuning
tuple also named `tau` by cuso. Preprocessing and failure probabilities must
be charged separately if this formula does not already include them. The
formula is not a measured complete-cost estimate.

For a frozen IC baseline of exponent cB, necessary model conditions for a
strict improvement are `beta<cB/2` and
`3beta+2gamma>3+tau-cB`. The current matched IC baseline cB has not been
reproduced in this study. Do not silently set it equal to rho.

For the separate rho reference cB=1/2, the conditions become
`beta<1/4` and `3beta+2gamma>5/2+tau`. Consequently gamma must exceed
7/8+tau/2 near the limiting beta=1/4; with gamma<=1 and tau>=0 one also needs
beta>(1/2+tau)/3 and tau<1/4. These are conditional requirements, not an
algorithm. The three finite certificate regions above have no overlap with
that modeled sub-rho region, even before charging losses or extraction cost.
This says nothing universal about improved shifts, other representations,
higher multiplicity, or the security of any curve.

The performance goal remains a matched, independently replayed complete IC
comparison: verified discrete logs and relation certificates; cold setup,
shift construction, Gröbner preprocessing, reduction, extraction, misses,
duplicates, rank, linear algebra and final verification charged; time and peak
memory recorded at multiple sizes; identical curves, subgroups, target seeds,
resources and success requirements in both arms. Report the speed ratio with
uncertainty and failures, plus the separate rho reference. A determinant
threshold or a planted-root success alone does not satisfy this goal.

## Admission and publication observations

The full repository was materialized. The backlog command reported
`GOAL-PFDR-fd09e0 approved_unrun=0 cap=none`. Two open lanes were found,
`BATCH-286bd3` and `BATCH-8d6d84`, both on the existing sibling research branch.
The goal's max_concurrent is 2. No lane was stolen, closed, or newly admitted.
The existing batch's ready-task query refused an unresolved
`archive.commit_sha` binding for TASK-20261017-56402f. This is not a result
about small roots and was not repaired by changing its archived records.

The configured Coordinator resolves to an unverified Anthropic model. Its
credential is absent. Probes of OpenAI, OpenRouter and ZAI likewise report
missing credentials; the configured local service refuses its connection.
Doctor exit code zero is not a verified backend: its warning text is retained.
The installed Codex CLI reports authenticated ChatGPT access, so the API
failures do not establish that all inference is unavailable. However, this
session has no receipt-bound independent Coordinator thread: no existing
SQLite state database was found in the exposed Codex directories. No fallback,
policy downgrade, model-verification assertion, or scientific dispatch occurred.
The next design requires a lawful lane and a verified runtime under the repo's
design-experiment rules, followed by a runnable frozen joint-system contract.

Full-ledger validation exits 1 with 106 errors outside all 61 changed paths
at input head d157d6015eb9f6b83feabe6b5fa65c281933cffa. Its complete output is
retained. This is not a clean global validation; no baseline entries were
added or suppressed. Branch-scoped merge hygiene passes. The study does not
repair unrelated ledger history.

The user explicitly authorized merge. The two observed CI defects have been
repaired and the artifact workflow passes on the merged-main head. Other
applicable hosted workflows remain queued/pending at this snapshot. The
active ruleset requires progress-fidelity, but does not list every applicable
check. Auto-merge is therefore left disabled while those checks are pending;
enabling it could merge before the other checks finish. This is a check gate,
not a renewed permission request. No failed or pending check was bypassed.

## Remaining gap and next check

The external goal is not achieved. The scoped reach/cost accounting is
reviewable; an optimized weighted joint construction and a verified complete
IC improvement remain absent. This is an implementation/admission and evidence
gap, not a mathematical impossibility claim or a closure of the lead. Repository
goals, hypotheses and the lead retain their existing scientific statuses.

Next: in a lawful lane with a receipt-bound Coordinator, freeze an adapter to
the pinned cuso source, affine windows, coefficient-height/denominator
conditions, weighted bounds and exact shift domain. Use the already successful
univariate calibration plus single-S3 and nearby-object controls. Predeclare
the joint workload and collect construction size/time/RSS before root recovery;
publish the inputs and pass native admission before execution. Require
independent normalization and extraction checks before selecting a random-target
panel. The old 0.8408 versus 8/9 margin remains unreconciled, not a target
already shown to be within reach.

Graph sources checked: the original `reach-cost.svg` and
`review-20261024/accounting.svg` report their frozen accounting, so they are
preserved. This report adds `weighted-reach.svg` and its drawing script.
No canonical curve/isogeny relationship or scientific status changed.
