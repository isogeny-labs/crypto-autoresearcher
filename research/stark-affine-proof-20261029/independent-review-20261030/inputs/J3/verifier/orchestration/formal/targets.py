"""Frozen formal task specs: `crypto.autoresearch.formal_task.v1`.

A spec is the unit both the CLI (`--task-file`) and the dispatch-stanza
generator (`tools/formal_task.py`) consume, so what a Coordinator queues and
what an executor runs are the same frozen text rather than two hand-copied
command lines that drifted.

A spec is a POINTER PLUS A CLAIM, NEVER AN APPROVAL: it cannot admit a task,
move a hypothesis, or stand in as evidence.  `source` names the committed
theory note the claim came from, because formalizing a claim nobody made
proves nothing about this program's research.
