# Graph-wide factor-base and target-input preparer

This is implementation preparation for the prospective 2,306-vertex study in
`../PROTOCOL-original-draft.md`. It produces one prepared input in the exact
format consumed by the existing `research/conductor_relation_yield_20261014`
triple collector. It does **not** launch that collector or estimate a DLP cost.

## Fixed semantics implemented

- Read only the archived full P29 or P37 walk. Reject incomplete paths,
  discontinuous indices, repeated `j`, or a mismatch with the archived graph
  and independent-verification digests.
- Recover the canonical source generator from the recorded short-Weierstrass
  isomorphism; use each edge's saved transported generator thereafter.
- Build `low_x`, `mid_x`, and `random_x` on every vertex; build `power_x`
  only when the path index is divisible by eight (P29) or four (P37),
  including index zero. At those same indices, `graph_transport` reads the
  archived image of the source `low_x` base and binds the chosen checkpoint,
  manifest, and terminal chain hashes. Build native and transported bases on
  the `u=2` coordinate model as separate controls.
- Use one domain-separated 256-bit target root per stratum and stage.
  Use a separate verifier root to derive the nonzero hidden Q scalar; draw
  `(alpha,beta)` from the target root with exact
  modulo rejection. Reject identity and repeated targets by their scalar
  in the prime-order group. Every arm and vertex within a stratum/stage
  receives the same accepted coefficient sequence. Roots for discovery and
  confirmation must differ.
- Require a post-freeze commitment to the base root, target root, archived
  graph manifest, and preparer/dependency source hashes. CLI quotas are fixed
  to the draft discovery/confirmation counts. The graph-transport arm also
  requires the checkpoint manifest and terminal hashes in the commitment.
  Output directories are
  exclusive; an interrupted write remains visible and is never overwritten.
- Solve-stage manifests also contain the public source-generator and
  source-target coordinates, bound by a digest. The scalar and verifier root
  are never written. The independent prepared-input checker validates the
  archived source curve and group membership; a separate path-transfer checker
  verifies that these points map to the exact finalist G,Q.

`prepare_graph_input.py` exposes a small-count `prepare` function for
implementation controls. Its CLI is for later admitted preparation only;
no commitment or scientific root has been issued in this directory.
The scientific CLI requires three distinct 256-bit base, target, and verifier
root files, plus a `isogeny-relation-seed-commitment/v2` record binding all
three digests. The optional verifier-root argument to `prepare` preserves
replay of historical fixed controls made before this correction; those
controls have no `seed_mode` field. New scientific inputs carry
`seed_mode: independent_verifier_root` and a verifier-root digest. Post-seal
seed replay supplies all three roots to `verify_prepared_graph.py`.

## Fixed implementation controls

`test_prepare_graph_input.py` ran 22 eight-target arm/vertex cases on both
strata. It checked repeatability, base sizes and distinct x-orbits, identical
target coefficients across arms, target group equations, the coordinate
transport identity, and the fixed `power_x` index rule. Three saved prepared
fixtures were replayed by `verify_prepared_graph.py` using independent point
arithmetic in `harness.toycurve`; the verifier also checked deterministic
base rules where applicable, signed pairs, uniqueness, group equations,
digests, and post-seal root replay. The raw control outputs and insight report
are in `controls/attempt-1/`.

These controls are not the prescribed discovery or confirmation streams.
They do not validate relation completeness, useful rank, a solver, or speed.
The verifier's optional root replay invokes the preparer and is a
reproducibility check; the point-equation replay uses separate arithmetic.

The later [graph-transport arm control](../graph_arm_20261022/report.md) ran
26 small arm/vertex cases across the same two strata. It independently
checked checkpoint bindings and rejected noncheck indices and an altered
checkpoint digest. At the first scheduled check vertices, the graph and
native bases have zero shared x-orbits in these fixed inputs; this is not a
relation-yield comparison. The original 22-case receipt remains historical.

## Remaining executable obligations

1. The source `low_x` base transport now covers the complete fixed paths:
   [P29 through edge 2,048](../path_transport/full_path_20261016/report.md)
   and [P37 through edge 256](../path_transport/p37_full_20261021/report.md),
   with independent saved-map and signed-base replay. The preparer now has a
   checkpoint-bound graph-transport arm at each scheduled check vertex. The [P37 endpoint
   control](../path_transport/p37_count256_20261022/report.md) also matches
   exact ordered counts on the same 128 fixed public targets used at its
   earlier check vertices. The original two-edge implementation control and
   censored predecessor remain in `controls/attempt-2/` and
   `controls/attempt-3/`. These public and planted controls do not establish
   targetwise equality on the post-freeze discovery stream. Bind that stream
   after implementation freeze and check its targetwise counts at the
   prespecified vertices before graph-wide inference.
2. Bind the collector, independent ordered-count oracle, rank verifier,
   fixed target roots and all output paths in a runnable versioned contract.
   Coordinator approval under the standing user authorization follows only
   when the execution-state checker reports ready.
3. The source G,Q point binding now supports rootless finalist path-transfer
   measurement. The new transfer runner and checker still need bounded
   controls and study admission. Complete the same-point IC solve path with
   relation collection, rank/linear algebra, individual log, independent scalar
   replay, all costs, and matched source/destination rho. Compare any
   completed improvement with the best frozen end-to-end IC baseline for
   that curve and size, reporting the remaining rho and Bernstein–Lange gaps.

The separate 20-arm conductor-step experiment remains governed by its own
frozen plan and recovery record. No data from these fixed implementation
controls enter either study's inference.
The remaining graph-wide implementation and admission obligations are tracked
in [the problem record](../../../problems/isogeny-graph-wide-relation-solver.md).
