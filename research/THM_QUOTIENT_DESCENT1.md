# THM_QUOTIENT_DESCENT1 — Only 2-torsion translations descend through a degree-2 quotient of E

- **Status:** PROVED (elementary). The Lemma's group-law identity is formalized as
  `CryptoResearch.Quotient.translation_commutes_iff_two_torsion`
  (`formal/CryptoResearch/Quotient/TranslationDescent.lean`, target
  `formal/targets/quotient-translation-descent.yaml`); see "Formal target" below.
  The theorem proves commutation with ι_S; descent follows by the prose argument, as stated
  in the file header. Named `translation_descends_iff_two_torsion` until 2026-10-23
  (sheriff SHF-20261017-e4d7f6 L-N9; see the correction of that date below).
  Companion to `IDEA-20260920-0490f5`.
- **Closes:** the "Larger group actions?" question on Galbraith's ECC 2015 slides, for every
  x-type coordinate.
- **Reads:** none required; the proof uses only the group law. Kohel (INDOCRYPT 2012) and
  FGHR (J. Cryptology 2014) are not frozen and may already state this; until they are read
  the note claims only "formalized here", not novelty.

## Setting

Let E be an elliptic curve over a field k, char k ≠ 2. For S ∈ E(k) let
ι_S = [−1] ∘ τ_S, i.e. ι_S(P) = −P − S = −(P + S). Every ι_S is an involution of E
(as a curve, not as a group), whatever the order of S, and every degree-2 map φ: E → P^1
defined over k is the quotient by some involution of this form up to an automorphism of
P^1 (the x-coordinate is the case S = O; the x-coordinate on a translate, P ↦ x(P + R),
is the quotient by ι_{2R}).

*Correction (2026-10-16, sheriff case SHF-20261016-3caa6f, finding L2).* This paragraph
first read "For S ∈ E[2](k)", restricting the degree-2 quotients to those by ι_S with S
2-torsion. That is wrong: S may be any point of E(k). The case reader's counterexample is
φ = x(P + R) on a curve over F_1009 with R of order 3, whose involution is P ↦ −P − 2R
with 2R not 2-torsion
(`research/sheriff/SHF-20261016-3caa6f/scripts/readers/lean/descent_check.out`). The
Lemma below is unaffected: its proof never uses the order of S, and it holds for every
S ∈ E(k), as the formal statement now says.

Write τ_T for translation by T ∈ E(k̄).

## Lemma

τ_T descends through φ = E/⟨ι_S⟩ — i.e. there is a map ψ: P^1 → P^1 with φ ∘ τ_T = ψ ∘ φ —
**if and only if 2T = O.**

## Proof

τ_T descends through the quotient by ι_S iff τ_T permutes the fibres of φ, iff
τ_T ∘ ι_S = ι_S ∘ τ_T (for a degree-2 quotient the fibre of P is {P, ι_S P}, so
"permutes fibres" is exactly "commutes with ι_S"). Compute both sides on P:

    τ_T ∘ ι_S (P) = −(P + S) + T
    ι_S ∘ τ_T (P) = −(P + T + S) = −P − T − S

Equal for all P iff −S + T = −T − S iff 2T = O. ∎

## Corollary (acting group for x-type summation polynomials)

Let f_m be any summation-type polynomial built on φ-values (f_m(φ(P_1),…,φ(P_m)) = 0 iff
Σ ±P_i ∈ {O} up to the fibre ambiguity). The group of translations acting on solutions
of f_m is E[2](k)^{m} ∩ {Σ T_i = O}, of order at most 4^{m−1} when full 2-torsion is
rational, so the full symmetry group from translations and permutations is a subgroup of
E[2](k)^{m−1} ⋊ S_m, order ≤ 4^{m−1}·m!. In particular:

- rational 2-torsion of rank 1 (double-odd curves, Montgomery form): (Z/2)^{m−1} ⋊ S_m;
- full rational 2-torsion: (Z/2)^{2(m−1)} ⋊ S_m;
- no rational 2-torsion (prime-order curves such as EcMasFp5): S_m only.

Anything larger — the (Z/4)^{m−1} of FGHR for curves with a rational 4-torsion point — must
come from a quotient of degree > 2, or from a curve automorphism, not from a translation
acting on a degree-2 coordinate. The trade this forces (higher quotient degree ⇒ higher
summation-polynomial degree) is what `IDEA-20260918-7a11c2` measures.

## Sage check (to run before minting the formal target)

    p = 1009; F = GF(p)
    E = EllipticCurve(F, [0, 2, 0, 5, 0])      # y^2 = x(x^2 + 2x + 5), T2 = (0,0)
    T2 = E(0, 0)
    P = E.random_point()
    assert (-(P + T2)).xy()[0] == (-P + T2).xy()[0]      # 2-torsion: commutes on x
    # pick T of order 3 (if present) and check the x-coordinates differ
    T3 = [Q for Q in E.torsion_subgroup() if Q.order() == 3]  # may be empty for this curve

## Formal target

    theorem_name: CryptoResearch.Quotient.translation_commutes_iff_two_torsion
    former_name: CryptoResearch.Quotient.translation_descends_iff_two_torsion (until 2026-10-23, sheriff L-N9)
    statement: ∀ (S T : E), (∀ P, -(P+S)+T = -(P+T+S)) ↔ (2:ℕ)•T = 0
    file:      formal/CryptoResearch/Quotient/TranslationDescent.lean
    target:    formal/targets/quotient-translation-descent.yaml

The statement needs only the abelian-group structure of E(k̄); no scheme theory. It is
proved for any additive commutative group and is built and axiom-audited by the
`formal-workspace` job of `.github/workflows/lean-verification.yml`. It formalizes the
Lemma's computation only: that degree-2 maps are quotients by some ι_S, and that
"descends" means "commutes with ι_S", remain the prose argument above.

*History.* The target was first written as a hypothesis `2•S = 0` plus this statement,
and committed as an unchecked statement stub, `research/THM_QUOTIENT_DESCENT1.lean`, that
declared it as a Lean axiom. Sheriff finding L1 (SHF-20261016-3caa6f) flagged the stub;
it was removed on 2026-10-16 when the theorem was proved. The hypothesis on S was unused
and is dropped, so the proved statement is stronger. Records that cite the stub (for
example `ledger/handoffs/TASK-20260923-aa277e.yaml` and the EXP-GFPN-05ff43 v1→v2
amendment) describe it, correctly, as an unchecked stub; the file is in git history.

## Correction (2026-10-17): Status-line change and the pre-minting Sage check

*Coordinator ruling DEC-20261017-edb475, on sheriff case SHF-20261017-e4d7f6, finding
L-N8.* This note is a living research note, not an immutable record. The immutable records
are the ledger entries that cite it (`IDEA-20260920-0490f5`, `DEC-20260920-11b44c`,
`DEC-20260921-683a85`, `TASK-20260923-aa277e`), and none of them binds its bytes by hash.
So it is corrected by dated, appended notes like this one, and the earlier text above
stays as it is.

- **Status line.** Until commit `418825c73` (2026-10-16) the Status line read "PROVED
  (elementary); not yet formalized." That commit rewrote it in place to the current
  wording, "formalized as `CryptoResearch.Quotient.translation_descends_iff_two_torsion`",
  with no dated note. What changed is only that the Lemma's group-law identity was
  formalized. The mathematical status (PROVED, elementary) is unchanged. The formal
  statement is commutation with ι_S; the step from commutation to descent is the prose
  argument above (sheriff finding L-N9). Sheriff case SHF-20261017-e4d7f6 built
  `formal/CryptoResearch/Quotient/TranslationDescent.lean` on the pinned toolchain
  (`lake build` exit 0; axiom audit: standard axioms only). CI has not built it, because
  `lean-verification` is disabled.
- **"Sage check (to run before minting the formal target)" is superseded.** The target is
  minted, and nothing committed shows that this Sage snippet was run. It is retired
  unrun and is not evidence. Its intended check (2-torsion translations commute on x;
  a translation of order 3 does not) is covered by committed outputs:
  `research/sheriff/SHF-20261016-3caa6f/scripts/readers/lean/descent_check.out` and
  `research/sheriff/SHF-20261017-e4d7f6/scripts/readers/lean/descent_recheck.out` Part D.
  Part D checks every T on two curves, over F_1009 and F_211, with S = 2R not 2-torsion.
  The Lemma agrees for 1008/1008 and 228/228 translations, and the translations that
  descend are exactly the 2-torsion ones (4 and 2).

## Correction (2026-10-23): theorem renamed to what it proves

*Sheriff case SHF-20261017-e4d7f6, finding L-N9.* The Lean theorem was named
`translation_descends_iff_two_torsion`, but it proves that τ_T commutes with ι_S, not that
τ_T descends; the step from commutation to descent is the prose argument above. It is now
`CryptoResearch.Quotient.translation_commutes_iff_two_torsion`, with the same statement and
proof; its docstring no longer says "descends", and the two unreachable `first` fallbacks
that raised linter warnings are removed. The Status line and the "Formal target" block
above now give the new name. Earlier text that quotes the old name (the 2026-10-17
correction) is left as written, and so are the immutable records that cite it:
`ledger/decisions/DEC-20260920-11b44c.yaml`, the sheriff case files, and the dated
verification logs under `docs/reports/`. Build and axiom-audit evidence:
`docs/reports/2026-10-23-translation-commutes-rename/`.
