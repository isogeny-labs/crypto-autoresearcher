"""Write the exact-byte approval previews of EXP-PEXT-0b2c75 and the preapproval packet.

Run from the repository root: python3 coordination/goals/GOAL-PEXT-4a1d6b/batches/BATCH-a4886a/approval-preview/prepare_packet.py [source_ref]
Writes, beside this script: specification.yaml (draft + freeze_fills), trial-plan.json, dispatch_queue.json,
handoff.yaml (executor), handoffs/TASK-20261024-5ab5b8.yaml (archive), lane.json (lane to open), preapproval-packet.json.
Nothing canonical is written; the committing session copies these to their canonical paths only after the probe
reports approvable true on pushed bytes. Re-run after any change to the draft or the implementation.
