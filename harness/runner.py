"""Run wrapper: execute a bounded experiment and emit an immutable run record.

Produces exactly the reproduction package required by
docs/evidence-and-reproducibility.md:

    experiments/<EXP>/runs/<RUN>/
        manifest.yaml   command.txt   environment.json
        stdout.log      stderr.log    raw-result.json

Every solve/relation claim is re-verified here with code independent of the
solver (the certificate discipline, docs/claims-and-verification.md); a failed
certificate makes the run invalid_measurement rather than a result. Run
directories are never overwritten -- the wrapper refuses to clobber an existing
RUN id.

The md5_collision_pair certificate kind (BCP-2 collision_certificate_format,
superseding BCP-1 section (c), GOAL-MD5-001) is verified here with the two
pinned independent MD5 implementations, and new runs written through
run_wrapped() carry wrapper-measured wall_seconds rather than
caller-supplied timing (DEC-20260810-1163ec F-4(b) and (e)).

    GOAL-ENDO-001 next action N6 (open since DEC-20260807-c8aa8b, promoted to
    blocking by CORR-20260807-0f5d56): `code.commit` plus a `dirty` flag does
    NOT identify the code that ran. Seventeen of EXP-ICINV-4d33aa's nineteen
    measurement runs recorded `dirty: true` with no per-file binding, which is
    why one EXP-INSTR-85b102 root cause is permanently unrecoverable -- the

    Content hashes fix this without forcing a commit-before-run workflow: an

    here, and a file that is edited later provably does not. `status` says how

                          a harness written in the same session that ran it)
        unreadable     -- could not be hashed; the run is NOT pinned
