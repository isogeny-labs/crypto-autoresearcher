"""The in-memory, read-only index the dashboard serves from.

Built once at startup from `ledger/`, `experiments/` and `knowledge/`, and
rebuilt on demand (`POST /api/refresh`). It never writes to the repository:
no ledger record, no coordination state, no derived file on disk. The
dashboard is an observer of the research program and holds no authority in
it -- it cannot approve an experiment, move a hypothesis, or stand in as
evidence (AGENTS.md rule 1).

Two tiers, as `ui/scan.py` explains: header fields for every record (fast,
approximate, drives lists and search) and a real `yaml.safe_load` for the
one record a detail view asks for (exact, cached). `verified: true` on a
record payload means the caller is looking at tier 2.
