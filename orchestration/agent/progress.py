"""Detect a narrow operational stall without judging research progress.

Only complete, consecutive tool rounds in which EVERY result is an explicit
tool error/refusal qualify. Arguments and complete results must be identical;
changing a call id or parallel-result order does not make it new work.
Successful polling, timeouts and command exit codes are deliberately excluded.
The transcript remains the evidence; no model call or external probe is used.
