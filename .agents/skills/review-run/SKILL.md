name: review-run
description: "Review another runner's experiment from its experiment.export/v1 bundle, without the producer's session, and file a write-once experiment.review/v1 record of checks, observations, per-claim judgments, open questions and a recommendation. Verifies hashes, protocol adherence, controls, a nonce-sampled replay where the backend admits one, a recompute of the headline numbers from the raw rows, statistics and scope. Use when asked to review, check, replicate or second-opinion a run, a benchmark or a sweep from any of the owner's repositories, before an evidence review or validation gate cites it, or on a schedule. Changes no research status and repairs nothing."

# review-run

Read `.claude/skills/review-run/SKILL.md` from this checkout and follow it. Resolve references and assets relative to that canonical directory. Preserve its authority and execution boundaries; this adapter adds no runtime role.

For research goals, follow the canonical skill's [default challenge research loop](../../../docs/challenge-research-loop.md), retaining problem, attempt and review pointers.

For goal-level boundary work, `autoresearch campaign frontier --goal <GOAL-ID>`
shows the fixed comparison domain, reviewed points, remaining gap and next test.
Carry those references; keep measured, modeled and unresolved claims distinct.
