description: "Send, read, and answer messages between agent sessions running in separate chats, worktrees, containers, or runtimes. Use when this session needs to tell another session something (a contract is frozen, a batch was reranked, a dependency failed), when checking for mail on wake, or when the user asks to connect or coordinate chats. Durable and write-once; survives the session."

# agent-bus

Read `.claude/skills/agent-bus/SKILL.md` from this checkout and follow it. Resolve references and assets relative to that canonical directory. Preserve its authority and execution boundaries; this adapter adds no runtime role.

For research goals, follow the canonical skill's [default challenge research loop](../../../docs/challenge-research-loop.md), retaining problem, attempt and review pointers.

For goal-level boundary work, `autoresearch campaign frontier --goal <GOAL-ID>`
shows the fixed comparison domain, reviewed points, remaining gap and next test.
Carry those references; keep measured, modeled and unresolved claims distinct.
