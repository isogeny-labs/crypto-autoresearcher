  Generate structured, falsifiable research proposals for an ECDLP research
  question. Use when starting ideation for a research question (RQ-*) or when
  the Coordinator requests fresh directions. Dispatches the idea-generator
  subagent and files proposals in the ledger.

# Propose ideas

Run the ideation stage of the research lifecycle (`docs/task-lifecycle.md`,
step 2).

## Steps

1. Identify the target research question. If the user named an `RQ-*` ID,
   read it from `ledger/questions/`. If no research question record exists
   yet, create one first from the template in `templates/research-records.md`
   and save it as `ledger/questions/<RQ-ID>.yaml`, minting the id with
   `python3 tools/allocate_id.py --next research_question --area <AREA>` and
   confirming it with `--check` (never "the next free number", rule 14).
   Before generating, merge `origin/main` into the working branch (merge,
   never rebase) so ideation runs against current ledger state — see
   "Branch and PR hygiene" below.
2. Gather context for the prompt: the research question record, relevant
   entries from `knowledge/` (grep by area tags), and — for dedup — the
   **generated indexes, never the corpus**: run
   `python3 tools/build_ledger_index.py` once and grep
   `ledger/.index/proposals.jsonl` and `hypotheses.jsonl` (id, area, status,
   question id, 200-char claim and mechanism) by the question id and the
   candidate mechanism's key terms. Open a full record only when its excerpt
   says it may be the same object. Reading `ledger/proposals/` directly is
   78 MB of context for a question the index answers in 0.5 MB. For ECDLP
   questions, render the known-results map
   (`python3 tools/build_frontier_map.py --area index-calculus` or
   `--area generic-rho`, or both) and paste it into the handoff verbatim, with
   the commit it was rendered at. The idea generator has no Bash; the map is
   what lets it see a published result before it re-derives it
   (`knowledge/frontiers/ecdlp/README.md`). Also paste the lead atlas
   (`python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --render`), which shows what THIS program
   already tried, closed or has queued (`knowledge/leads/ecdlp/README.md`).
   Then run `python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --brief`. If it says nothing changed
   since the last review and no lead is `open_unexamined`, then the useful
   ideas are either a better next step for an open lead or a new lead, and the
   handoff says so.
3. Dispatch the **idea-generator** subagent with a handoff that includes the
   research question, the context found above, how many ideas are wanted
   (default 3; the ECC process maximum is 3 per session), and any user
   constraints. Remind it that every idea record
   must be schema-complete and novelty-checked against `knowledge/` before
   any novelty label stronger than `unverified`, and must carry a `prior_art`
   block naming the map rows it was positioned against (required by
   `tools/validate_ledger.py` for IDEA-20261001-* onward). After ideas come
   back, run `python3 tools/build_frontier_map.py --match "<claim + mechanism>"`
   and `python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --match "<claim + mechanism>"` on each.
   Send back any idea whose top hit is a row or lead it did not cite, or whose
   `prior_art.lead` is a closed lead whose obstruction the idea does not
   answer. Every ECDLP idea from IDEA-20261025-* carries `prior_art.lead`.
   From IDEA-20261101-* onward, an existing lead also requires
   `prior_art.lead_delta`: `kind: advances_next_action` for an open lead or
   `kind: answers_obstruction` for a closed lead, plus a `statement` naming
   the exact new information, test, or changed assumption. Merely renaming the
   mechanism or citing the lead does not pass validation.
   When an idea declares `lead: new`, add the lead row in the same PR. The handoff must also direct
   it to the exemplar search heuristics in `agents/idea-generator.md` and the
   target profile in `docs/target-result-profile.md`: exponent-first ambition,
   hunting external structural ingredients, meet-in-the-middle decompositions,
   distribution heuristics plus re-randomization, and reduction-network
   cascades — and require the `heuristic_assumptions` and `target_complexity`
   fields on every idea.
   When the question targets a heavily mined ECDLP lane — index calculus,
   factor-base design, point representations, quotient or coordinate
   objects — also paste the constraint block from
   `docs/object-frame-ideation.md` into the handoff, so the generator
   searches (representation, operation set) pairs against the recorded
   rigidity results instead of regressing to a known family in new notation.
4. Verify each returned idea against the schema in
   `agents/idea-generator.md`: claim, mechanism, predictions with metrics,
   minimal test, controls, falsification conditions, named heuristic
   assumptions each with an experimental validation route, target time and
   memory exponents versus the best known, and cost. Send incomplete
   ideas back to the subagent for completion — do not repair them yourself.
   Count every idea you send back; the count goes in the session receipt
   (step 7), which is the only place this signal exists (`tune-skill`,
   "Bounces").
5. Save each complete idea as `ledger/proposals/IDEA-YYYYMMDD-<tok>.yaml`
   (`python3 tools/allocate_id.py --next idea --date YYYYMMDD`, then
   `--check`). Keep a proposal under 8 KB: the claim, mechanism, predictions,
   minimal test and falsification conditions are the record; a derivation,
   literature walk or worked example goes in a sibling
   `ledger/proposals/<IDEA-ID>.notes.md` that the index does not read.
   `tools/validate_ledger.py` reports larger new proposals as advisories.
   The Coordinator then runs an isolated snapshot archive task that commits
   the exact research-question, proposal, and any literature-note paths before
   treating the ideas as filed. The task must pass the dispatcher's post-commit
   verification.
6. Push the branch and open or refresh a PR against `main` naming the new
   `RQ-*`/`IDEA-*` records, then enable auto-merge
   (`gh pr merge <n> --auto --merge`; see "Branch and PR hygiene"). A filed
   idea that exists only in a local commit is not a proposal the program can
   use.
7. Report to the user: one-line summary per idea (ID, class, claim,
   novelty status, cost) plus the generator's recommended first test, and
   end with `python3 tools/session_receipt.py --skill propose-ideas --role
   coordinator --outcome proposed --created <RQ/IDEA ids> --bounced <n>`
   (`docs/session-receipts.md`), where `<n>` is the step 4 count, `0` when
   nothing was sent back.
   For ECC work the receipt enforces the design-record process budget in
   `orchestration/research-priority.yaml`; reaching it defers additional
   unfiled ideas and does not constrain runs or later sessions.

## Branch and PR hygiene

Ideation generates shared research records, so every run of this skill also
pulls in `main` and surfaces the new proposals as a PR:

- **Before generating:** `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main` — merge,
  never rebase. If the merge conflicts, stop and report; never resolve a
  conflict by editing a record (corrections supersede, per AGENTS.md rule 4).
  Re-run `tools/validate_ledger.py` after the merge.
- **After the snapshot archive:** `git push -u origin <branch>`, then open or
  refresh a PR against `main` with the runtime's PR tool, titled
  `ideas: <summary>` and naming the `RQ-*`/`IDEA-*` ids. Use `gh pr create`
  only where `gh auth status` succeeds; a session with no PR tool reports the
  pushed branch.

## Rules

- Ideas are proposals only. Do not create hypothesis records or approve
  anything here — that is `/design-experiment` under Coordinator authority.
- Never overwrite an existing proposal file.
- Do not let an uncommitted proposal become a candidate for `/design-experiment`.
- Do not strip or soften `heuristic_assumptions` or `target_complexity` when
  filing ideas: a conditional claim must stay conditional, with its validation
  route and exponents intact.
