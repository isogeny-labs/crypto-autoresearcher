  Inspect or maintain exact curve identities, EC1 aliases, curve UIDs, field
  metadata, trait catalogs and comparison imports. Use for catalog work and
  identity mismatches. Use endo for CM analysis, transfer for maps, and run
  for trials.

# Curve records

Read `docs/curve-identities.md` and `tools/curve_identity.py`. For UI ingestion read `ui/README.md` and `ui/curves.py`.

1. Bind the exact field (including basis/polynomial), curve model, coefficients, subgroup, cofactor, generator and target group. Keep unknown facts null.
2. Preserve the producer's hash preimage. Use `curve_identity`, `inspect_manifest`, and `candidate_identity` from the existing helper; do not build a parallel identity convention.
3. Keep curve identity separate from factor-base, isogeny route, algorithm, workload and run identities. Equal degree, order or j-invariant does not identify a curve representation.
4. For a trait import, retain upstream commit/path/hash, measurement parameters, source status and applicability. Place supplementary traits outside the curve identity preimage. Unknown and not applicable are different states.
5. Check conflicts and precision at the UI boundary; preserve large integers and fail closed on pin/identity mismatches. Update catalog pins with the corresponding artifact.
6. Return exact IDs, sourced traits, unresolved values, and a focused diff or identity report. Never turn a metadata hash into a security or speedup badge.

Follow current `AGENTS.md` authority, provenance and immutable-record rules. This profile adds no prerequisite to `run`; preserve explicit execution requests.

## Default challenge research loop

Research goals use [the default challenge research loop](../../../docs/challenge-research-loop.md). Preserve the frozen problem, candidate, evidence and review pointers relevant to this skill. Work within its existing role; findings guide the next attempt, and a worker completion alone is not scientific acceptance.

For goal-level boundary work, `autoresearch campaign frontier --goal <GOAL-ID>`
shows the fixed comparison domain, reviewed points, remaining gap and next test.
Carry those references; keep measured, modeled and unresolved claims distinct.
