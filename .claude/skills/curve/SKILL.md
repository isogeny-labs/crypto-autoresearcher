  Inspect or maintain exact curve identities, EC1 aliases, curve UIDs, field
  metadata, trait catalogs and comparison imports. Use for catalog work and
  identity mismatches. Use endo for CM analysis, transfer for maps, and run
  for trials.

# Curve records

Read `docs/curve-identities.md` and `tools/curve_identity.py`. For UI ingestion read `ui/README.md` and `ui/curves.py`.

1. Bind the exact field (including basis/polynomial), curve model, coefficients, subgroup, cofactor, generator and target group. Keep unknown facts null.
2. Preserve the producer's hash preimage. Use `curve_identity`, `inspect_manifest`, and `candidate_identity` from the existing helper; do not build a parallel identity convention.
3. Keep curve identity separate from factor-base, isogeny route, algorithm, workload and run identities. Equal degree, order or j-invariant does not identify a curve representation.
4. For a trait import, retain upstream commit/path/hash, measurement parameters, source status and applicability. Place supplementary traits outside the curve identity preimage. Unknown and not applicable are different states.
5. Check conflicts and precision at the UI boundary; preserve large integers and fail closed on pin/identity mismatches. Update catalog pins with the corresponding artifact.
6. Return exact IDs, sourced traits, unresolved values, and a focused diff or identity report. Never turn a metadata hash into a security or speedup badge.

Follow current `AGENTS.md` authority, provenance and immutable-record rules. This profile adds no prerequisite to `run`; preserve explicit execution requests.

## Curvesmash challenge context

For work linked to a Curvesmash objective, use [the shared challenge workflow](../../../docs/research-challenges.md) and preserve the track id and pinned source references. Apply this skill only within its existing role and the user's named scope.
