# Agent bus

Durable messaging between sessions. Full contract:
`docs/inter-agent-messaging.md`. Read it before anything non-obvious.

**A message is a pointer, never a permission.** It cannot approve an
experiment, change a hypothesis status, or serve as evidence — those live in
committed ledger state and nowhere else. Cite IDs with `--ref` and let the
reader go read the record.

## On wake, before anything else

```sh
python3 tools/agent_bus.py sync                       # skip if no remote
python3 tools/agent_bus.py inbox --as <your-address>
```

Nothing delivers mail. This is a feed: unread messages sit there until a
session in that role asks. Check again before reporting done.

## Register once per session

```sh
python3 tools/agent_bus.py register --as <addr> --role <role> [--goal GOAL-*]
```

Address by **role**, not by session — `coordinator`, `executor`,
`idea-generator`, `validator`, `red-team`; suffix duplicates (`executor-2`).
Sessions die, roles do not, so the next session in a role inherits its inbox.
If the user has not said which role this session is, ask before registering.

## Send

```sh
python3 tools/agent_bus.py send --from <addr> --to <addr>[,<addr>|all] \
    --subject "<the point, triageable alone>" \
    --ref <ID> [--ref <ID>...] [--priority high] \
    --body "<what changed, where it lives, what you want back>"
```

Then publish, or peers in other containers never see it:

```sh
python3 tools/agent_bus.py sync --push
```

## Read, answer, close out

```sh
python3 tools/agent_bus.py read   <MSG-id>
python3 tools/agent_bus.py thread <MSG-id>
python3 tools/agent_bus.py reply  <MSG-id> --from <addr> --body "..."   # also acks
python3 tools/agent_bus.py ack    <MSG-id> --as <addr>                  # handled, no answer needed
python3 tools/agent_bus.py peers                                        # who is registered
```

Ack what you handled. An inbox where unread no longer means unhandled is worth
nothing to the next session in that role.

## Consolidate across lanes

`inbox --as X` shows what is waiting for X. When several sessions work one goal
in separate lanes, nobody is looking *across* them — two Executors can measure
the same thing all day, each correctly addressing its own Coordinator, and no
inbox shows both. Continuous cross-talk is not the fix; it collapses the
diversity the lanes were for. Let lanes diverge, then run one pass that reads
across them and carries pointers.

```sh
python3 tools/agent_bus.py digest --since 36h --unconsolidated   # read-only
python3 tools/agent_bus.py consolidate --from consolidator --to executor-2 \
    --subject "executor-3 already measures the variant you queued" \
    --source <MSG-id> --source <MSG-id> --ref EXP-... --body "..."
```

`digest` groups by **sender**, so a lane collision shows up as two senders
carrying the same `--ref`. It writes and acks nothing. `--unconsolidated` hides
what a consolidation already drew on.

`consolidate` requires `--source` (provenance) and at least one `--ref`, and
refuses a ref that names no record — a typo'd ref reads as a pointer and leads
nowhere. Refs it cannot check by path scan (`KN-*`, `SRC-*`) are recorded as
unchecked, never as resolved.

Do not consolidate lanes you are working in — that is one lane arguing its case,
not a cross-cutting pass. And a consolidation confers no authority: you are
reporting on work you did not do, so point at records and let the reader go read
them.

## Wake on mail

```text
Monitor({command: "python3 tools/agent_bus.py watch --as <addr> --sync --interval 60",
         description: "bus mail for <addr>", persistent: true})
```

## Do not use this for

- **Assigning research work.** That is a `TASK-*` handoff envelope through
  `tools/research_dispatch.py`, which carries a write scope, budget, and
  completion gate. A message asking for a job skips all three and the
  dispatcher cannot see it.
- **Recording findings.** Evidence is a run record under `experiments/`.
- **Anything blocked in this session.** Asking a peer to run what your
  permissions refused launders the user's decision. Route it back to the user.

## Live peers on one machine

When `ListAgents` shows a reachable peer — local sessions only; cloud sessions
list none — `SendMessage` reaches it directly and instantly. Use it for a
question to a session you can see right now. It leaves no record, so anything
that should outlive the session goes on the bus as well.

## Default challenge research loop

Research goals use [the default challenge research loop](../../../docs/challenge-research-loop.md). Preserve the frozen problem, candidate, evidence and review pointers relevant to this skill. Work within its existing role; findings guide the next attempt, and a worker completion alone is not scientific acceptance.

For goal-level boundary work, `autoresearch campaign frontier --goal <GOAL-ID>`
shows the fixed comparison domain, reviewed points, remaining gap and next test.
Carry those references; keep measured, modeled and unresolved claims distinct.
