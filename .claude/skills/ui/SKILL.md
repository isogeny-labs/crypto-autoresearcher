# Research UI

Read `ui/README.md`, `ui/payloads.py`, and the relevant reader module. Preserve the shared live/static data contract.

1. Trace the source record through parsing, pins/adapters, payload and renderer. Keep source-reported values, verification states, unknowns and declared versus observed dates distinct.
2. Change the reader or import adapter within the requested scope. Do not add ledger-authoring or research execution controls to a read-only dashboard.
3. Preserve exact global curve/candidate/workload identities, large integers, trait parameter sets and source links. Use curve and bench for data/semantic checks.
4. Exercise affected Python payload tests and JS reader tests; use the documented browser smoke test when layout/navigation changes warrant it. Do not run experiments to populate a preview.
5. Use `python3 -m ui` for the local reader and `python3 -m ui.build` for a requested static export after checking current flags. Bind source links to the public repo or immutable revision; do not expose credential-bearing origin URLs.
6. Return the changed behavior, preview/test evidence and missing data. Building a static output is not deployment; publish only within the user's requested scope.

Follow current `AGENTS.md` authority, provenance and immutable-record rules. This profile adds no prerequisite to `run`; preserve explicit execution requests.

## Curvesmash challenge context

For work linked to a Curvesmash objective, use [the shared challenge workflow](../../../docs/research-challenges.md) and preserve the track id and pinned source references. Apply this skill only within its existing role and the user's named scope.
