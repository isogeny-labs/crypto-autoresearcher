description: >-
  Assess lifts, descents, field extensions, isogenies, curve covers and
  Jacobian correspondences: does moving the problem to another curve, field
  or Jacobian make it easier? Use to audit a supplied map, cover or descent
  claim, or claimed speedup. Produces certificates, cost accounting and open
  obligations.

# Assess mathematical transfers

Use this as an assessment profile, not a new runtime role or execution harness.
Audit supplied constructions and bounded educational examples. Separate
mathematical correctness, implementation correctness, modeled cost, and measured
advantage. Do not autonomously search production targets for key-recovery
weaknesses or launch a logarithm-solving campaign.

Read [the methodology](references/methodology.md). Start a companion assessment
from [the JSON template](assets/assessment-template.json). Treat it as a draft,
not an authoritative ledger record or mathematical certificate.

## Assess the correspondence

1. Ground source, destination, fields, representations, subgroup, workload,
   and baseline in supplied artifacts. Preserve canonical identifiers;
   distinguish the ambient group from the relevant subgroup.
2. Type every transformation. Distinguish curve morphisms from induced group
   homomorphisms, isogenies from isomorphisms, and extensions from restriction
   of scalars. Record dimensions and the field of definition.
3. Classify each obligation as `unknown`, `supported`, `refuted`, or
   `not_applicable`. Attach evidence and scope, or a justification for
   not-applicable. Missing evidence is not failure.
4. Assess existence, executable construction, map correctness, subgroup
   preservation, measured computational advantage, and scaling separately.
   Require explicit formulas before assigning measured transfer costs.
5. Examine homomorphism identities, kernel intersection, exceptional points,
   normalization, working-field descent, and recovery. Distinguish proofs from
   implementation tests. Describe the certificate and unresolved obligations.
6. State a falsifiable benefit and complete cost model. Include construction,
   conversion, unsuccessful attempts, verification, recovery, memory, and
   reusable preprocessing. Label measured and modeled quantities separately.
7. Specify paired controls and a reproducible protocol for bounded small
   examples. Include transported-data and coordinate-isomorphism controls.
   Route actual trials through the host's existing execution entry point.
8. Record construction-family applicability, equivalent representations, and
   the precise exploration boundary. Return `not found within this family and
   boundary`, never universal nonexistence from an unsuccessful bounded search.
9. Report the narrowest supported finding, limitations, and a concrete next
   obligation. Recommend official status changes only through the authorized
   Coordinator and independent review process.

## Feed an experiment contract

When `design-experiment` drafts a contract whose claim crosses a map, build
the assessment from the template, save it beside the specification, and write
the contract's `transfer_obligations` entry from it (`docs/confound-control.md`,
section 4): the typed map, what it preserves and what it changes, and the
coordinate-isomorphism and matched-random controls named as variable-ledger
comparisons. The weakest open obligation bounds what the experiment may claim.

## Preserve host authority

In Crypto Autoresearcher follow `AGENTS.md`, `docs/curve-identities.md`, citation
provenance, archival ownership, and existing model policies. Search available
knowledge before claims of novelty, prior testing, or literature obstruction.
Disclose unavailable retrieval or dependencies. Keep assessment work within existing
roles and permissions. Keep `run` as the single scientific execution skill;
add no mandatory assessment preflight to run requests. Preserve immutable
records and use additive corrections.

Deliver an obligation table, typed correspondence graph, source-linked report,
cost table, controls, exploration boundary, and open obligations. Link artifacts
by exact identity and revision. Keep the weakest unresolved obligation visible
on composed paths. Apply the host's `research-visuals` requirements to substantive
mathematical searches. Static skill creation is not a scientific finding.

## Curvesmash challenge context

For work linked to a Curvesmash objective, use [the shared challenge workflow](../../../docs/research-challenges.md) and preserve the track id and pinned source references. Apply this skill only within its existing role and the user's named scope.
