An exact, finite certificate for the three bitmask polynomials in the archived
BINSTD n=17 toy inputs. Bit `i` of a natural number represents the coefficient
of `X^i` over F₂. The archived field modulus is `131081 = 2^17 + 2^3 + 1`;
the two degree-eight masks are `313` and `471`.

`remFuel` performs the recorded XOR-and-shift reduction on natural-number
encodings. `noSmallMonicDivisor` tries every monic encoded divisor of degree
one through half the encoded polynomial's degree. Its three concrete
equalities below are checked by Lean's kernel through `decide`.

This file does not prove that `remFuel` equals Euclidean remainder in
`(ZMod 2)[X]`, nor that the bitmasks denote the polynomials in
`Factorization.lean`. Consequently these equalities are finite encoded
certificates, not Lean irreducibility theorems or a Frobenius-model bridge.
