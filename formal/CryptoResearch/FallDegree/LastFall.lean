Under the stated hypotheses, the last fall degree is the greatest degree at
which a degree fall occurs.

Claim:  THM-FALLDEG-INVARIANTS1-THM-2-8

Caminata-Gorla Theorem 2.8 identifies the global greatest fall degree. A
finite Macaulay rank profile gives the exact invariant only after its rows
are proved to compute the iterated closure spaces and a bound excludes later
falls. Neither measurement bridge is supplied by this theorem.

Scope, and it is narrow. This is a theorem about the INVARIANT `d_F`, proved
from Definition 1.5 and nothing else. It says nothing about Semaev systems,
bounds nothing about any particular family, and is not evidence toward the
growth question in RQ-DREG-bd6c86. It does not by itself prove a bound on the
solving degree (CORR-20260916-0c9c0a).

Finiteness of `d_F` is an explicit HYPOTHESIS here, not a theorem. Caminata and
Gorla get it from the existence of a Groebner basis; reproving that would drag
in exactly the machinery this target was chosen to avoid, so it is assumed and
said out loud.

NON-VACUITY IS NOT MACHINE-CHECKED HERE. The theorem is conditional on `hfin`
and `hfall`; this file does not construct an `F` satisfying them. The independent
source review works out the example `F = {x², x²+x}` with last fall degree 2.
Formalizing a witness would require showing `x ∉ V F 1`, a genuine closure
lower bound. The example is mathematical evidence, not a Lean declaration.

/-- **Definition 1.5.** `V F i` is the smallest `k`-subspace of the polynomial
ring that contains every element of `F` of total degree at most `i` and is
closed under multiplying by anything that keeps the total degree within `i`.

The closure condition is written `f.totalDegree + g.totalDegree ≤ i` rather
than `g.totalDegree ≤ i - f.totalDegree`. On `ℕ` that subtraction TRUNCATES: if
`f.totalDegree > i`, the second form still permits degree-zero multipliers,
while the sum condition permits none. -/

    (∀ f ∈ W, ∀ g : MvPolynomial σ k,

/-- The family is monotone: a larger budget admits more. Both defining
conditions strengthen as `i` grows, so the constraint set shrinks and its
infimum grows. -/

/-! ### The defining properties of `V`

`V F i` is an INFIMUM, so it is not automatic that it satisfies the two
conditions defining the family it is the infimum of. Both are preserved by
intersection, which is what makes "the smallest such subspace" well posed and
what makes `V` usable rather than opaque. -/

`D` in a per-degree Macaulay rank profile certifies `d_F ≥ D`, with no need to
know `d_F` in advance. -/

/-! ## Bounds on `d_F`

Theorem 2.8 identifies `d_F`; it does not bound it. These do, in both
directions, and both from Definition 1.5 alone -- no Groebner machinery. -/

/-- `F` admits ideal-membership representations of degree at most `D`: every
`f` in the ideal is `∑ c_g · g` over generators `g ∈ F`, with every term's
degree inside `max D (deg f)`.

SOME representation always exists -- that is `Submodule.mem_span_set` and is
just what generating the ideal means. All the content here is the DEGREE BOUND
on it. -/

/-- **Upper bound on the last fall degree.** `d_F` is at most any degree in
which ideal membership can be certified.

The bound is real but it is not small: the representation degree is itself a
hard quantity, doubly exponential in the worst case by effective
Nullstellensatz. What this buys is that `d_F` never exceeds it -- the last fall
degree cannot be worse than writing the membership down. -/

/-- **Finiteness of `d_F` stops being an assumption.** Theorem 2.8 takes
`(lastFallSet F).Nonempty` as a hypothesis, which Caminata-Gorla obtain from the
existence of a Groebner basis. A representation-degree bound gives it directly,
so Theorem 2.8 can be applied from a checkable hypothesis instead of an assumed
one. -/
