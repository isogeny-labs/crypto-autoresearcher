# Formal research workspace

This directory is the default Lean workspace for the formal research lane.
The lane treats a theorem prover as an experimental instrument: models may
propose statements and proofs, but only tool-produced build/audit evidence is
accepted as machine-verification evidence.

The [2026-10-18 retrospective](../research/lean_retrospective_20261018/README.md)
adds the certificate, affine-normal-form and commutator-refutation targets,
retains per-target recheck receipts, and records outstanding proof and semantic
coverage. Its summary concerns frozen formal targets, not every historical claim.

Candidate sources are written here by `MathCodeFormalizer`
(`docs/mathcode-integration.md`), which runs the MathCode engine in a
throwaway directory under `.formal-attempts/` and copies in only a file that
passes a pre-stage scan. **Nothing containing `sorry` ever lands here**, by
design: the worker's forbidden-construct scan covers every `.lean` file in this
workspace, so one unfinished candidate left behind would invalidate every later
task run against it. Unfinished candidates stay in their attempt directory and
are reported as proof obligations.

A formal result is **not** authoritative research state. A successful Lean
build must still receive an independent semantic-fidelity review confirming
that the formal proposition matches the human claim and is not vacuous or
weakened by hidden assumptions. Only the canonical Coordinator may promote a
reviewed artifact into official claim/ledger state.

The [2026-10-19 foundation retrofit](../research/lean_foundations_20261019/README.md)
adds full constructive reachability, point-action bridges and a pinned shared
cyclic-group library. CI requires all 66 frozen target proofs to remain present
and machine-verified. Independent fidelity evidence is linked from that study.

## Expected workspace contract

A concrete Lean project placed here should contain:

- `lean-toolchain`
- `lakefile.toml` or `lakefile.lean`
- a pinned `lake-manifest.json`
- theorem source files
- `AxiomAudit.lean`

The worker runs:

```bash
lake build
lake build +CryptoResearch.YourModule
lake env lean AxiomAudit.lean
# The worker also generates and runs an audit of the exact requested theorem.
```

and rejects proof sources containing `sorry`, `admit`, custom `axiom`
declarations, or `unsafe` declarations.

Bring the workspace up (needs network and `elan`), then check and run:

```bash
./formal/setup.sh                 # writes lean-toolchain + lake-manifest.json
autoresearch formal doctor
autoresearch formal formalize --task-file formal/targets/ncp-affine-normal-form.yaml
```

`targets/` holds the frozen task specs; `CryptoResearch.lean` is a generated
root module (`tools/rebuild_formal_root.py`) and is not committed.

## What CI checks

`lean-verification.yml` runs two jobs, and the difference matters:

- **`kernel-controls`** builds `formal/smoke`, the pinned dependency-free
  control project, and runs the harness's Python tests. It is fast and it
  proves the plumbing works. **It does not build any theorem in `formal/`.**
- **`formal-workspace`** is the proof gate: it fetches the Mathlib cache and
  runs `tools/verify_formal_targets.py`, which puts every *discharged* target
  through `autoresearch formal verify` -- the same build, axiom audit and
  per-theorem target audit the worker runs.

Run the gate yourself with the workspace up:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_formal_targets.py --artifact-dir /tmp/receipts
```

A target whose `theorem_file` does not exist yet is reported as undischarged
and does not fail the gate; staging a spec before proving it is the normal
order of work. A run that verifies *nothing* does fail, because a gate that
machine-checks no proof and reports success is the hole this job was added to
close. An infrastructure failure exits 3 and is reported separately: CI is red
either way, but a toolchain that fell over is never negative evidence about a
claim (AGENTS.md rule 3).

Green here still means machine-verified and nothing more -- independent
semantic-fidelity review is a separate gate, and it is the one that decides
whether the Lean statement is the claim anyone cared about.

## CVP reference pattern

The initial design is inspired by Mira-acc/cvp: keep the executable formal
proof, a human-readable argument, a pinned toolchain/dependency graph, and a
separate axiom audit. We reuse that verification discipline rather than
copying CVP-specific lattice definitions into the autoresearcher.

For existing proofs, use `autoresearch formal verify --task-file <spec>
--artifact-out <new-receipt>` without MathCode. See
[the direct Lean workflow](../docs/formal-research-lane.md#running-lean-directly).
The pinned dependency-free `smoke/` project and `tests/test_lean_live.py` qualify
the verifier using real positive and negative controls before research use.
