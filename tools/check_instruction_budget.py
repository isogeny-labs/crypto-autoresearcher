"""Word budgets for the instruction a session reads before it acts.

`docs/track-record-review-20261006.md` (P1.6) measured the always-loaded
contract at 12,146 words -- more than the longest skill, read by every session
before it did anything -- and set two budgets:

  * ALWAYS_LOADED: AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md, loaded by every runtime on every
    wake, at most 6,000 words.
  * WAKE: the always-loaded set plus the one skill or agent contract a session
    actually runs, at most 9,000 words. Checked for every skill under
    .claude/skills and every generated agent under .claude/agents, since a
    session loads one of each at most.

Budgets are on words (`str.split`), the same number `wc -w` prints, so a
reader can verify a failure with one command. A failure names the file and
the overrun; the fix is to move narrative to docs/ and link it, never to
raise the budget to match what was just written -- a budget moved to turn a
red check green has stopped being a check. Raising one is a reviewed change
to this file with the reason in the commit.
