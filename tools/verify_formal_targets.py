"""Machine-check every DISCHARGED formal target, and refuse to pass vacuously.

This is the CI gate for the formal research lane.  It is deliberately thin over
`autoresearch formal verify`, which is where the gate actually lives: forbidden
construct scan, `lake build`, project-wide `AxiomAudit.lean`, and then a
per-theorem audit that confirms the REQUESTED theorem was in what got audited.
Re-implementing any of that here would give the lane two definitions of
"verified" that could drift apart.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  `lean-verification.yml` built `formal/smoke` -- a pinned,
dependency-free control project -- and never the `formal/` workspace where
theorem files live.  So the job was green whether or not any proof compiled,
and the first real theorem landed on `main` with no CI having built it.

A TARGET WITH NO THEOREM FILE IS NOT A FAILURE.  The lane freezes a target spec
before anyone proves it; seven of the eight committed targets are in exactly
that state.  Work not yet done is reported as undischarged and does not fail
the gate -- otherwise staging a target would break the build for everyone.

BUT AN EMPTY RUN IS A FAILURE.  If nothing is verified, this gate is a no-op
that passes, which is the failure mode it was written to remove.  So it asserts
a FLOOR on the number of targets verified, per the corpus-count discipline in
CLAUDE.md: a floor, never an exact count, because discharged targets only
accumulate.  Raise `--min-verified` when the lane has reviewed proofs to spare;
never lower it to turn this green.

INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE IS NOT NEGATIVE EVIDENCE.  AGENTS.md rule 3 is explicit,
and the verifier already separates the two: exit 1 is a mathematical verdict
(build failed, audit failed, forbidden construct), exit 3 is the toolchain
falling over.  Both leave CI red -- neither is a verified proof -- but they are
reported separately and this script exits 3 for the latter so a lake or network
failure is never read as a proof that did not check out.
