"""Audit which committed run manifests pin the source that produced them.

GOAL-ENDO-001 next action N6, open since DEC-20260807-c8aa8b and promoted to
BLOCKING by CORR-20260807-0f5d56.

THE DEFECT THIS MEASURES. A run manifest records `code.commit` and a boolean
`code.dirty`. When `dirty` is true the commit does not identify the code that
ran, and nothing else in the manifest does either. Seventeen of
EXP-ICINV-4d33aa's nineteen measurement runs are in exactly that state. The
consequence is not hypothetical: EXP-INSTR-85b102's D6 root cause is
permanently unrecoverable because the pre-repair source existed only in a dirty
tree and no hash of it was ever written down. An independent Validator could
corroborate the stated mechanism for one of three affected cells and could not
establish it for the other two.

WHAT COUNTS AS PINNED. `harness/runner.py:source_provenance` writes
`code.source.files[<path>].sha256` for every repo `.py` the run actually
imported, derived from `sys.modules` rather than from a declared list. A run is
PINNED when `code.source.all_pinned` is true. Pinning is deliberately weaker
than a clean tree: an untracked or modified file is fine as long as its content
is hashed, because the hash stays valid once the file is committed and provably
fails if the file is later edited. That keeps the ordinary
write-a-module-then-run-it workflow legal while making it auditable.

A run launched by tools/experiment_execution.py is also PINNED BY ITS PLAN
when run.environment.source_sha256 is a non-empty mapping of sha256 digests and
run.environment.sources_committed is true: the supervisor refused the launch
unless every bound source was tracked, unmodified at the launch commit and
equal to its digest. That covers the files the frozen plan binds, not every
module the driver imported, so it is reported separately ("plan-pinned")
(sheriff case SHF-20261106-a114e7, ICV-2; units launched after that change).

THIS TOOL IS ADVISORY BY DEFAULT AND SAYS SO. Every run predating the fix is
unpinned, and retroactively erroring on them would convert one campaign's debt
into every campaign's red build -- the coupling `check_merge_hygiene.py` and
`main-health.yml` were split apart to remove. Use `--since-commit` to scope the
audit to runs added after the fix landed, or `--strict` to exit non-zero on any
unpinned run in scope.

Usage:
    python3 tools/check_run_source_provenance.py
    python3 tools/check_run_source_provenance.py --experiment EXP-ICINV-4d33aa
    python3 tools/check_run_source_provenance.py --since-commit <sha> --strict
