# Hard ceiling on queue.max_concurrent. REMOVED (None = uncapped) on the
# user's EXPLICIT DIRECTION of 2026-08-05: "remove the concurrent limit from
# the code rules." Previously fixed at 3. THE AUTHORIZATION IS THE USER'S AND
# IT IS NOT A COORDINATOR SELF-GRANT, same footing as the maximum_batches
# amendment on GOAL-AES-003's campaign_budget.
#
# What this does NOT relax: a queue must still declare a positive integer
# max_concurrent; write_scope conflict detection and archive-must-run-alone
# isolation are unaffected; nothing here waives per-task budgets or the
# review requirement on claim-changing results.
#
# The risk this ceiling existed to bound is on the record, not removed by
# removing the check: GOAL-AES-003 BATCH-002 ran three producers on a 4-core
# machine against the goal's own instruction that a batch wait rather than
# run degraded, load average reached 13, one producer's entire first segment
# produced zero numbers and another lost five of eight trials to timeouts
# (DEC-20260802-b226fb budget_accounting). A queue that raises
# max_concurrent above the machine's real headroom will reproduce that
# failure; the Coordinator dispatching it is responsible for sizing it to
# the environment, the same way sizing was always the Coordinator's job

    """Report cards whose `fallback_allowed: false` this machine cannot honour.

    `false` is the safe default in AGENTS.md's handoff template, and it is the
    RIGHT default: it forbids silently substituting a model for the one a policy
    binds. But a checkout with no credentials for the bound backend cannot serve
    that binding at all, so `false` there is not a safeguard -- it is a claim
    every dispatch breaks, discovered when a returning agent reports
    `fallback_used: true` against a card that forbade it.

    That is not hypothetical. It happened twice on BATCH-a33cda within a day, for
    two different causes -- an exhausted billing quota (TASK-20260915-4f4027) and
    absent API keys (the two reviewer cards, DEC-20260916-7b2235) -- and both were
    repaired by amending a card AFTER the work had run. Two amendments for one
    root cause is the tell that the default was wrong for the machine rather than
    that the dispatches were unlucky.

    THIS IS ADVISORY AND MUST STAY ADVISORY. Refusing the dispatch would block
    every open card in exactly the environments where the runtime-native binding
    is the legitimate route (AGENTS.md core rule 16 permits it), which would turn
    a paperwork defect into a research stoppage. What the dispatching Coordinator
    needs is to see it BEFORE launching, so the card can declare the binding up
    front instead of being amended afterwards.

    An advisory is not permission either: it does not authorize a substitution.
    Only a Coordinator `inference_amendment` on the card does that, and a card
    already carrying one is not reported.

        THE COMMIT BINDING IS NOT DURABLE AND THE CONTENT BINDING IS. A squash
        merge replaces a branch with one new commit, so every `commit_sha` an
        archive receipt recorded becomes unreachable and every `parent_sha`
        becomes wrong -- while every `path_sha256` still matches the bytes on
        main. Five goals carried unresolvable commits for exactly this reason
        (CORR-20260802-a1f151); the same records' content hashes all still
        verified.

        Failing on that punishes an archive for the repository's merge strategy,
        which is not a property of the research. So when the commit cannot be
        reached, this verifies the declared path hashes against the current tree
        and records the degradation instead of raising. A CONTENT MISMATCH IS
        STILL FATAL -- what is relaxed is the binding to a commit, never the
        binding to bytes.

        `tree_ref` chooses WHICH tree those bytes are read from, and the choice
        is the whole difference between the `content_first` and
        `content_at_commit` binding modes. Reading HEAD asks "does the record
        still say what the archive said it said", which is the right question
        for a squash-merge recovery and the wrong one for a record that is
        allowed to change afterwards. Reading the archive's own commit asks
        "did the archive commit these bytes", which no later legitimate
