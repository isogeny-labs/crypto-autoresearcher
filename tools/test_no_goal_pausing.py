"""Pins CLAUDE.md rule 10 / AGENTS.md "Goals are never paused".

A goal may not take `status: paused` or `status: blocked`. Both were removed
from the permitted set on user instruction (2026-09-04).

`blocked` is pinned alongside `paused` deliberately: it is the same idling
under another name, and a rule that refused only `paused` would be cosmetic —
the next session wanting to stop a goal would simply write `blocked`.

The tests below also pin the three things the rule does NOT relax, because the
danger of "never pause" is that it reads as permission to close, to promote a
claim whose review tier cannot be served, or to spend past a budget. Those
guarantees live in prose, so what is pinned here is that the prose is present
and says so — a doc test, and deliberately shallow about it.
