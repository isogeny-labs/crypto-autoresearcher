"""Refuse the three merge defects that reached main in the PR #55/#58 window.

`validate_ledger.py` is a *relative* gate: CI compares the error set on the head
against the error set on the base and fails only on strings that are new. That
design is right for a corpus with 1138 grandfathered legacy errors, and wrong
for the failures below, each of which slipped past it for its own reason:

  1. CONFLICT MARKERS. Nine files reached main carrying literal `<<<<<<< HEAD`
     lines -- among them two coordinator decisions, two evidence records and
     `knowledge/techniques/KN-TECH-056.md`, which `CLAUDE.md` names as the
     inventor-protocol abstract. Nothing looked for them, so nothing found
     them. A record holding a conflict marker is not a record.

  2. UNPARSEABLE RECORDS MASKING THEMSELVES. A record that does not parse
     cannot be schema-checked, so breaking it *removes* errors. Under a
     relative gate that reads as an improvement. Worse, `EV-SSI-002`'s invalid
     `proof_status` sat undetected on main precisely because the surrounding
     conflict markers made the file unreadable -- the corruption hid a second
     defect. Parseability is therefore absolute here and never baselined.

  3. CROSS-BRANCH ID COLLISIONS. `CLAUDE.md` says to find the next free number
     "by grepping the relevant directory", and `allocate_id.py` does that well
     across the whole identifier space -- but only within one working tree. Two
     branches grepping their own trees concurrently both see the same next free
     number. That is not a mistake either branch can detect: it is a property
     of the pair. `DEC-20260728-004` was allocated twice for unrelated
     decisions this way, and `CORR-20260729-003`/`-004` are live on two open
     PRs right now. Collisions must be found against the *remote*, before the
     merge, while renumbering is still cheap.

Checks 1 and 2 are absolute and offline. Check 3 needs a ref to compare
against and is skipped, loudly, when none is available. Runbook-session
directories are also immutable (`check_session_files`): against ``--base`` and
against each parent of a merge, no existing session file is deleted or changed,
the journal grows only by append, and every touched session still hashes to its
own journal.

    python3 tools/check_merge_hygiene.py                    # 1 and 2
    python3 tools/check_merge_hygiene.py --base origin/main # 1, 2 and 3

Exits non-zero on any violation, so it can be a pre-commit hook and a CI gate
without a wrapper.

    it", and the originals are preserved broken on purpose, immutability working

    # Parseability must stay absolute SOMEWHERE, for the reason in defect 2 of
    # this file's header: a record that does not parse cannot be schema-checked,
    # so breaking one REMOVES errors and reads as an improvement under the
    # diffed validator. That argument is about a branch MASKING ITS OWN damage,
    # and scoping to the files a branch touched preserves it exactly -- if you
    # broke a record, you changed it, and you are still caught.
    #
    # What the absolute sweep additionally caught was breakage that was ALREADY
    # ON MAIN, and making that every unrelated campaign's problem is a real cost
    # rather than a benefit: six truncated JSON run records from one AES batch
    # red-lighted every other campaign's PR, including one whose diff touched
