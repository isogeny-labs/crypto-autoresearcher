"""Tests for the read-only research dashboard (`ui/`).

Two things are worth testing here and they are different in kind.

The first is ordinary: the shallow scanner handles every record shape this
corpus actually contains, and the index derives the right boards from them.
Those tests use fixtures and are exact.

The second is a calibration, and it is the reason this file also reads the
real ledger: `ui/scan.py` is deliberately approximate in its first tier, and
an approximation is only safe while somebody measures the error. The
agreement test below parses a sample of real records both ways and asserts
the shallow reading matches the exact one. If a future record shape breaks
the scanner, that test says so instead of the dashboard quietly showing
blank rows.
