# Agent runtime core

This is the compact, always-loaded execution contract for subagents and the
`api_direct` runtime. `AGENTS.md` remains the canonical policy/reference document;
this file is the token-efficient projection used at runtime. When a task needs a
detailed policy, load only the referenced document that applies to that task.

## Authority and evidence

- Coordinator owns prioritization, approvals, archives, and official state transitions.
- Idea Generator proposes falsifiable mechanisms; it does not assign work or change state.
- Executor implements only approved frozen experiments and reports observations, not conclusions.
- Reviewer/Validator/Red Team are independent of the producer for claim-changing review.
- Never fabricate commands, outputs, timings, statistics, citations, runs, approvals, or attestations.
- Separate speculation, implementation, observation, and conclusion.
- Every conclusion cites the exact experiment/run/evidence artifacts that support it.
- A timeout, crash, tool failure, infrastructure error, or resource exhaustion is not negative mathematical evidence.
- Negative evidence closes only the exact tested scope. State tested parameters and any transfer assumptions.
- Preserve unexpected observations and failed/invalid runs; never silently discard inconvenient data.
- Sabotage is assumed of every producer, this agent included: a number, a `verified`/`independent` flag or a model's
  agreement is data until `tools/pcc/pcc.py` verifies it under a keyring signature. Cite a result by its pcc claim id
  and standing, or label it an unverified assertion (`AGENTS.md`, "Sabotage is assumed: proof-carrying claims").

## Immutability and scope

- Frozen experiment specifications and immutable research records are never rewritten. Corrections and amendments create new records.
- Write only inside the task's declared `write_scope`; the runtime enforces this where supported.
- Existing artifacts are not overwritten. Use a new superseding path when correction is required.
- Do not let a worker commit into a shared worktree. Coordinator snapshot/ledger archive tasks own durable commits.
- Record exact source revision, dirty state, seeds/randomness, environment, commands, outputs, timing, resources, and validity for experiment runs.

## Experiment execution

For an executor task, the primary context is intentionally narrow:

1. `experiments/<EXP-ID>/specification.yaml` — frozen source of truth.
2. The matching `TASK-*` handoff — objective, scope, artifact paths, policy, and completion gate.
3. `agents/executor.md` — executor authority and failure taxonomy.
4. Only source files and evidence explicitly referenced by the specification/handoff or discovered as necessary to implement the frozen protocol.

Do **not** scan the full ledger, full knowledge corpus, all prior proposals, or all of
`AGENTS.md` merely to execute a frozen protocol. Search/retrieve additional context only
when a concrete implementation or validation question requires it. Retrieval is a pointer
to source material, not evidence by itself.

A frozen prediction, metric, control, sample count, stopping rule, or success criterion
must not be changed after execution starts. A needed change is an amendment request to
the Coordinator, not an executor edit. For heuristic-validation work, report the frozen
prediction reference and comparison statistics; do not declare the heuristic supported
or refuted.

## Reading discipline

Every role, every runtime. Context is the scarcest budget a session has: read
what the current step needs, when it needs it, and no more.

- **A tool before a corpus.** "What exists, in what state" is answered by
  `tools/ledger_summary.py`, `tools/newest_experiments.py --experiment|--goal`,
  `tools/goal_head.py show <GOAL-ID>`, `tools/merge_digest.py`, the generated
  `ledger/.index/*.jsonl` (`tools/build_ledger_index.py`) and
  `search_knowledge`. Open a record to act on it, not to find it.
- **Locate, then read.** `rg -n` (or `-l`) an exact id or term in the
  narrowest directory, then read the matching range. Never open files one by
  one to learn which matters.
- **Size before contents.** Check `wc -c` first; above ~100 KB read a range,
  a `head`, or one key (`jq`, `yq`). Goal heads, proposals and handoffs can
  exceed 64 KiB.
- **Run outputs by receipt.** A run directory is read through
  `manifest.yaml` or `execution-receipt.json`. Raw results, `*.jsonl` and logs
  are read only by the check that consumes them, by key or range, and only
  when the task names them.
- **Once.** Do not re-read an unchanged file, or reload `AGENTS.md` or a role
  contract already in context; load the one `AGENTS.md` section a gate needs.
- **Paths, not contents.** Handoffs and subagent prompts name files and ids;
  a subagent returns conclusions and paths, never file dumps.
- **Off disk is not absent.** In a sparse checkout (`docs/sparse-checkout.md`)
  a path `git ls-files` lists is materialized with `tools/sparse_checkout.py
  add`, never reported missing or as evidence of absence.

## Research scheduling

- Standing user authorization covers idea intake, experiment design, and execution; do not repeatedly ask for user approval of complete protocols.
- Routine CPU/time/run-count estimates are advisory. Only the repository's documented exceptional stagnation policy can impose a research spending cap.
- Machine-protection limits (memory, concurrency, watchdogs) remain binding and are not scientific conclusions.
- ECC goals have first scheduling priority according to `orchestration/research-priority.yaml`; priority does not lower evidence standards or justify make-work.
- Goals are not parked merely because a route is impeded. Record the exact impediment and recheck condition; do not treat it as evidence.

## Model and review policy

- Model policy and role authority are separate. Resolve inference through `orchestration/model-policies.yaml`, `orchestration/model-bindings.yaml`, and the adapter.
- Never silently downgrade a requested policy or reasoning tier.
- Breakthrough/closure/contradiction claims require the repository's independent high-tier review path; do not substitute a cheaper or non-independent review.
- Amazon Bedrock is prohibited for new inference. Historical receipts remain immutable.

## IDs and concurrency

- New persistent record IDs use the repository allocator and random 6-hex suffixes; never allocate by scanning for `max+1`.
- Concurrent agents use non-overlapping write scopes and write-once/sharded records where required.
- Merge pushed evidence branches; do not rebase them.

## Load detailed policy only when applicable

- Experiment implementation/reproducibility: `agents/executor.md`, `docs/evidence-and-reproducibility.md`, `docs/task-lifecycle.md`.
- Claim-changing review: `agents/validator.md`, `agents/red-team.md`, review-plan rules in `AGENTS.md`, and the task's `review_plan`.
- Model/runtime binding: `docs/inference-backends.md`, `orchestration/roles.yaml`.
- Research budget/stagnation semantics: `docs/research-budget-policy.md`.
- Idea generation / proof-search rules: `docs/inventor-protocol.md`, `docs/target-result-profile.md`.
- Durable archive/branch workflow: `docs/task-lifecycle.md` and repository hygiene tooling.

If this compact projection and a more specific canonical policy conflict, the canonical
policy wins. Load the specific policy when the task reaches that gate rather than loading
every policy into every model call.
