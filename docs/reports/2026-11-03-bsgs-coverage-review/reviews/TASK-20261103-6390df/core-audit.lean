Baby-step giant-step coverage: the premise the runbook conformance example
(`examples/runbooks/toy-ecdlp-bsgs/`) relies on when it treats an unsolved
instance as a defect rather than an observation.

Source:  examples/runbooks/toy-ecdlp-bsgs/README.md ("Why `solved` is a
         validity condition"); the solver is solve.py (`bsgs`: a table of
         `j*G` for `0 ≤ j < m`, giant steps `Q - i*(m*G)` for `0 ≤ i < m`).
Target:  formal/targets/runbook-example-bsgs-coverage.yaml

WHAT IS PROVED (core Lean: `Nat`).
* `coverage`: for `0 < m` and `k < m * m`, the decomposition
  `k = (k / m) * m + k % m` has both digits below `m`. So with `m` baby steps
  and `m` giant steps every exponent `k < m * m` is reached, and the giant step
  at which it is reached is `k / m` (the solver reports `giant_steps = k / m + 1`).

WHAT IS NOT PROVED. Nothing about the group, the curve, the solver's code, or
its cost: this is the counting identity alone. That the example picks
`m = isqrt(n - 1) + 1`, so `n ≤ m * m` and every `k < n` is covered, is
checked numerically by `check.py`, not here.
