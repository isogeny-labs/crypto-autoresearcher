# ECDLP lead atlas

**What this program has already tried against the elliptic-curve discrete log,
one mechanism family per file, across all four repositories. It is written so
that a fresh clone answers "has this been done?" by computation, not by
re-reading 280,000 files.**

The known-results map (`knowledge/frontiers/ecdlp/`) records what the
*literature* established. This atlas records what *we* did: each lead's
disposition, the obstruction that closed it or the next step that would decide
it, and the evidence in `crypto-autoresearcher`, `crypto`, `cryptanalysis` and
`ecc-challenges`.

```sh
python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --brief          # what the session-start hook prints
python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --match "idea"   # leads and KR rows an idea collides with
python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --delta          # watched paths changed since the last review
python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --coverage       # ECDLP ledger records with no lead
python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --pursuit        # every lead not disproven in scope
python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --check          # CI (make check-ledger)
python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --render --out knowledge/leads/ecdlp/ATLAS.md
python3 tools/lead_atlas.py --stamp <session> # close a review: pin every repo's HEAD
```

## Why it exists

At the first 2026-10-24 review the ledger held 2,049 ECDLP-area hypotheses and ideas. 971 of its
1,031 hypotheses (94%) had no terminal status. Every new session re-surveyed the same ground, and idea generation
re-proposed mechanisms that an earlier lane had already measured or closed. The
known-results map stops re-derivation of *published* results. Nothing stopped
re-derivation of *our own*.

The later 2026-10-24 coverage reconciliation maps 2,078 current records. Its
29 new mappings and two open transfer leads are recorded in
`docs/reports/ecdlp-lead-atlas-20261024/coverage-20261024-mapping-review.json`.
`REVIEW_STATE.json` still identifies the earlier four-repository review; coverage
alone does not certify a fresh review of every changed sibling path.

## What "already done" means

`REVIEW_STATE.json` pins the commit of each repository at the last completed
review. `--delta` lists the watched paths (ledger records, ideas, findings,
problem records, research notes, leaderboards) added or modified since those
commits. The session-start brief combines that with the tallies:

- **nothing new since review**: every lead and every idea in the four
  repositories has been examined. The work is the open leads' `next_action`s,
  or a genuinely new lead that `--match` does not find.
- **changed since review**: fold the listed paths into leads (skill
  `lead-atlas`), then `--stamp`.

The atlas is **saturated** when three gates hold together: no lead is
`open_unexamined`, every ECDLP ledger record maps to a lead in `coverage.tsv`,
and nothing has changed since the review. Saturation is a reporting state. It
pauses no goal (AGENTS.md "Goals are never paused"), and open next steps remain
work.

### Pursuit invariant

Only `closed_obstructed` removes a lead from the pursuit queue, and only for
the mechanism and assumptions its obstruction actually covers. The atlas
renders every other disposition in `--pursuit` and in the generated report's
Pursuit queue:

- `closed_known` remains pursued when a new implementation, parameter regime,
  or improvement beyond the reproduced known result becomes available;
- `closed_dominated` remains pursued at the condition that could remove the
  stated dominance;
- `exhausted_at_scale` remains pursued at its explicit scale or capability
  trigger; and
- all `open_*` rows remain pursued directly, including blocked and unexamined
  work.

A timeout, bounded null, resource limit, missing implementation, or dominance
on finite toy rows is not a disproof. If a `closed_obstructed` row is later
found to cover only one submechanism, reopen or split the uncovered mechanism;
do not let the broad title inherit a narrow obstruction. This scheduling view
changes no hypothesis, experiment, or goal status.

## Layout

```text

  README.md               this file
  REVIEW_STATE.json       commits examined, date, reviewer, tallies (--stamp writes it)
  coverage.tsv            <ledger record id> TAB <lead id | NONE>, every ECDLP H-* and IDEA-*
  ATLAS.md                GENERATED (gitignored): --render

Families: `generic` (RHO), `ic-binary` (ICB), `ic-engine` (ICE), `ic-prime`
(ICP), `transfer` (TRF), `structure` (STR), `exotic` (EXO).

Dispositions:

| disposition | meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `closed_obstructed` | a named theorem, proof or controlled measured scaling shows it cannot beat the matched baseline in scope |
| `closed_known` | a literature result (KR or KN-LIT) the program reproduced; nothing new in scope |
| `closed_dominated` | works, but another lead (`dominated_by`) strictly dominates it |
| `exhausted_at_scale` | measured across the reachable range with controls, no improvement, no named mechanism left; `revisit_when` names the scale that reopens it |
| `open_next_step` | a concrete, runnable, discriminating next step exists |
| `open_blocked` | the next step is known but blocked (`blocked_by`) |
| `open_unexamined` | ideas exist; no experiment or evidence has touched it |

## Rules

1. **A closure names its obstruction** (AGENTS.md "Research direction":
   premature closure fails like overclaiming). A null or timed-out search is
   not an obstruction; use `exhausted_at_scale` with the scale reached, or an
   open disposition.
2. **The atlas changes no research state.** A disposition cites the decision,
   evidence or known-result row that decided it; hypothesis, experiment and goal
   statuses move only by Coordinator decision records.
3. **Rows are curated and editable.** A review updates `disposition`,
   `next_action`, `evidence` and `last_reviewed` in place; git keeps the history.
   Never delete a lead: a lead absorbed into another becomes `closed_dominated`
   or names the successor in `related`.
4. **Every ECDLP idea names its lead.** From IDEA-20261025-* on, an idea whose
   `prior_art.frontier_map` is an ECDLP map carries `prior_art.lead`: a LEAD id
   it advances, or `new` with `new_lead_reason` saying why `--match` found
   nothing (`tools/validate_ledger.py`). A new lead is added to the atlas in the
   same PR as the idea.
5. **Gaps to rho are distance remaining**, never pass or fail (AGENTS.md "Every
   improvement is a success"). Superseded leaderboard wins are not results.
